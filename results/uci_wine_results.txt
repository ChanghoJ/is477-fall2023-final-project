----- Final evaluation ----- 
According to the accuracy score from the 'train' model of logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest model, logistic regression model performed best among the three models. Therefore, we choose logistic regression for the best model to use 
Then, according to the accuracy score of 'test' model of logistic regression, the model performed 1.0 accuracy, precision, and recall. Therefore, the final evaluation of logistic regression model in the wine class classification dataset has 'perfect' performance, correctly label each of classes of quality of wine without any false labels.
